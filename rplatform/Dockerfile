# NOTE:
# This Dockerfile is stored under "rplatform" directory but it will be
# moved to top level project directory during image build by RP so
# all local paths should be relative to your project's top level
# directory.
#
# NOTE2:
# Base images with tag 3.5.1_rp0.0.75 and later are built as user 'rstudio'
# which belongs to sudoers, so every command requiring root permissions should be
# preceded with 'sudo' - otherwise add layer 'USER root' to run all commands as root.
# It is recommended to not to change 'rstudio' user due to permissions issues
# within Docker container, because container's RStudio Server is run as 'rstudio'.
